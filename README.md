# Classify-Customer-Churn
Problem Statement : Classify Customer Churn:
Identify which customers are likely to leave a
telecom company based on usage patterns.
Introduction
The goal of this project is to classify
customers who are likely to churn (leave a
telecom company) based on usage patterns
and service-related data. In addition,
customer segmentation using clustering
techniques is performed to identify
customer groups with similar
characteristics.
Methodology
1. Data upload and preprocessing
2. Label encoding for categorical features
3. Splitting dataset for classification
4. Applying RandomForest for churn
prediction
5. Evaluating with accuracy, precision,
recall
6. Creating a heatmap for confusion
matrix
7. Scaling features and using PCA for
visualization
8. Applying KMeans clustering for
segmentation
